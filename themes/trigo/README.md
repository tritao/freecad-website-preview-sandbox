# Trigo Theme for Hugo

Trigo is a custom made theme for the [Hugo Static Side Generator](https://gohugo.io/).
It is developed specifically for the [FreeCAD website](https://www.freecad.org/).

Trigo aims for simplicity, ease of use and flexibility.
Contributions of new features, tweaks and improvements are very much welcome!
Anyone with basic knowledge of Hugo, web standards, HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript will hopefully feel at ease.
Its architecture, methods and documentation are made simple yet efficient in a *FOSS* spirit.

The [website documentation](https://freecad.github.io/Website/dev/web) in the Development handbook provides usage explanations and guidelines with many detailed examples.

Trigo is inspired by numerous existing Hugo themes, such as PaperMod, Hextra, the official Hugo docs theme and many more.

## Theme Overview

The Trigo theme is based on a standard Hugo theme structure: it uses a set of HTML wrapping template actions to transform Content, Data and Resources (in `layouts` directory), some CSS stylesheets and JavaScript (the last two in `assets`).
Translations tables for theme `i18n` strings are used as well.
Bundled icons are available in `assets/svg`.


## Style

The style of the theme is defined in CSS stylesheets in `assets/css`.
The `main.css` file defines the stylesheet files to import.
Reusable variables are found in `vars.css` in both **Light** and **Dark** variants.
Some additional project-specific variables are defined the project configuration parameters (`/config/_default/params.yaml`) under the `style` key, such as `accent-color`, `font-sans`, `font-mono`, etc.
General selectors and properties are in `body.css`.
The site Header, Footer, Hero and Content sections are defined in `header.css`, `footer.css`, `hero.css`, and `content.css` respectively.
The `404.css`, `archive.css`, and `share.css` define the style for these special pages respectively.
The `highlight.css` defines the style for code highlighting.
The `media.css` defines the style for different devices and screen sizes via media queries (flex and responsive changes).
The `shortcodes.css` defines the style for bundled shortcodes.
Finally, the `custom.css` defines the style of project-specific custom partials and reusable classes.


## Layouts

Each Layout inherits from `layouts/_default/baseof.html` which contains the Main structure of the Page, including the Head.

Default Layouts use either:

- `home.html` for the Homepage at the Content Root (i.e. `/content/<locale>/_index.md`).

- `list.html` for **List** Pages in each Sections (e.g. Releases list, News list, Documentation lists).

- `single.html` for **Single** RegularPages (e.g. Release notes, News articles, Manual pages).

- `archives.html` for listing all relevant RegularPages in a Section with an `archives.md` file.

- `taxonomy.html` for listing all relevant Terms of a Taxonomy (e.g. Event, Announcement for the Categories Taxonomy).

- `term.html` for listing all relevant Pages associated with a specific Term.

To organize the code and avoid duplications, the default Layouts may include **Partials** depending on the context. A Partial is just another piece of code that also performs template actions, to keep the code *DRY*.


## Code formatting and syntax

Hugo SSG templates, methods and functions generally use `PascalCase` formatting (e.g. `{{- with .RegularPages -}}`) and `camelCase` for default fields and method aliases (e.g. `{{- hasPrefix $foo $bar -}}`).

Trigo custom naming uses `snake_case` for `custom_param`, `custom_partial.html`, and `$local_variables`, to help distinguish from official Hugo syntax.

CSS classes and IDs use hyphens like `custom-class`.

Naming should be as short and explicit as possible. A variable assigned from the result of a boolean test should be named `$is_test`, while numbers, strings, dates, arrays (slice), map (dict), and other types should be named appropriately (e.g. singular vs plural, limits, enable vs disable).

Beware of Hugo **Context** and **whitespace trimming** concepts, as they are tricky to get at first. See [Hugo official docs](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction) as reference.
