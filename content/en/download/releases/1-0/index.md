After more than 20 years of development, the 1.0 release marks a major milestone for the FreeCAD project.

With a strong focus on stability, usability, and long-requested core features, FreeCAD is now more powerful, flexible, extensible, and robust than ever before.


{{< block title="Robust Solid Modeling" >}}

{{< group >}}

> [!NOTE]
> FreeCAD now tracks how individual sub-elements (faces, edges, vertices) evolve through modeling operations by building a history map that records whether elements were modified, generated, or deleted.
> This allows stable references to be maintained even as the underlying topology changes.

- The mitigation algorithm to the long-standing topological naming problem has finally been merged
- Models now better survive edits without randomly breaking dependencies
- Parametric workflows and complex design iterations are far more predictable, resilient, and effective
