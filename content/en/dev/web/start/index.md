## Development

### Building

> [!NOTE]
> The FreeCAD repository and its theme are currently compatible with Hugo 0.160.0

To build the website locally:

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (standard edition).
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
3. Optionally if developing Hugo modules, install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).
4. Clone this repository (or download the Code Zip via the green button on the top-right and unzip it):

```shell
git clone -b main https://github.com/FreeCAD/Website.git
```

5. Open the terminal at the cloned or downloaded repository location.
6. Build the site locally and launch the [live server](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/) from within the root directory of the site:

```shell
hugo server
```

Building should be relatively fast (about 10 seconds) and without errors.

To view the website locally, open the web browser at the indicated address, by default `https://localhost:1313/`.

### Deployment

This project uses a `development` > `testing` > `production` environments logic:

- The `development` environment is the local clone. The result can be seen on the web browser after following the [Building instructions above](#building).
- The `testing` environment is the `main` branch of this `website` repository. The result can be seen on [GitHub Pages](https://freecad.github.io/Website/).
- The `production` environment is hosted on FreeCAD's server. The result can be seen on [FreeCAD website](https://www.freecad.org).

Testing builds deployment to GitHub Pages is done automatically by workflow Actions whenever the `main` branch receives a new commit. The built artifacts are stored in the `pages` branch (extracted from the `public` dir when the `hugo` command is run). The official website version is built from the `prod` branch instead.

### Browser support

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Internet Explorer isn't supported.

When using and making changes, keep in mind this website only supports *evergreen browsers*:

- Firefox (latest version, N-1 version, and latest ESR version)
