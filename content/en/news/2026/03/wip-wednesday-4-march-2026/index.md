Maintainers have been backporting some of the fixes to the v1.1 branch where possible - 3 backports in the past 7 days. The list of changes in this recap applies to the main development branch (future v1.2).

This week in FreeCAD development:

**Sketcher**:

- FlachyJoe fixed a regression to make symmetry work on arcs with constrained centers again ([PR#24466](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/24466)).

- wwmayer fixed an offset geometry issue (cherry-picked by 3x380V, [PR#27930](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27930)).
- Krrish777 improved the error message displayed when links in Sketcher objects go out of their allowed scope ([PR#26776](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/26776)).

**Part and PartDesign**:

- kadet1090 fixed the 3D View button in the Location sections of the Part GUI to stay pressed when it is active ([PR#27879](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27879)).

- Roy-043 provided several patches:
  - Patched BIM_DrawingView to always create the Cut Lines view ([PR#27853](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27853)).
  - Fixed window hinge direction if edge has no delta Z ([PR#27476](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27476)).
  - Changed TD BIMView linecaps to square ([PR#27682](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27682)).
  - Removed superfluous transaction handling when editing IFC properties ([PR#27313](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27313)).
- furgo16 ixed the placement jump when uncloning objects ([PR#27597](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27597)) and added quick-access option taskboxes to all relevant objects ([PR#27746](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/27746)).
