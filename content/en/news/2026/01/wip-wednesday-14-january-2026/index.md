This week in FreeCAD development:

**Draft**: Roy-043 fixed the setting of the AutoColor property of sketches to False before applying colors ([PR#25781](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/25781)) and an error on constrained movement in the edit mode ([PR#26868](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/26868)).

- Dimitris75 fixed the experimental waterline algorithm ([PR#26658](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/26658)) and fixed the 3D surface rotational scan ([PR#26553](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/26553)).
- tarman3 delivered the usual slew of changes:
  - Removed the duplicated movement to the clearance height at the end of the Slot operation ([PR#25842](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/25842)).
  - Used the Job.GeometryTolerance property to set the precision of segmentation complex shapes while creating a path in the Tag, Engrave, and Deburr operations ([PR#26127](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/26127)).
