This week in FreeCAD development:

**Sketcher**:

- theo-vt fixed an issue in the new autoscaling feature, and NewJoker contributed a tooltip for it.
- fermino fixed an issue that could result in a crash in certain scenarios with missing references.

**CAM:**

- kadet1090 fixed the visual appearance of the origin indicator.
- tarman3 changed the warning about the Array operation becoming obsolete to show up only when you try to create a new array.
